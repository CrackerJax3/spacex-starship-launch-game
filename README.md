# Unofficial SpaceX Starship Lander Game

In the genre of [Lunar Lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(video_game_genre)) games we simulate launching the SpaceX Starship to orbit,
deploying Starlink satellites and returning both the booster and upper stage to Earth 
to be caught on the launch pad.  

Attempt the famous landing flip maneuver.
